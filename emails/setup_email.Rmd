We're looking forward to welcoming you to the RSE Sheffield training session on _Introduction to Conda for Data Scientists_.


### SETUP

Prior to attending, you need to **install the software we are going to use. <span
style="color: #d1410c;">Please ensure you have completed setup before the course begins.</span>**

Instructions on how to install all the software required can be found on the [**Setup
chapter**](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/setup/) of the course materials. If you have
any problems with your setup, please get in touch with us for assistance *before* the course begins.


If joining an on-line version of the course, we recommend using a two screen set up if possible so you can observe the
live demonstration on one screen and perform the practical exercises on another.

### SCHEDULE

We’ll **kick off at `r params$event_start_time` on `r format(strptime(params$event_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%a %b %d
%Y")`** and aim to finish `r format(as.POSIXct(paste(params$event_date, params$event_finish_time)), "%H:%M")` which
should last around another 3 hrs.

There will be some time at the end of the day for questions and discussions.

### ATTENDANCE

**In the event that you can no longer make it, we please ask that you cancel your ticket so we can offer it to someone
on the waiting list**. 

### COURSE DELIVERY PLATFORM

We will be using [Blackboard Collaborate](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/apse/digital/collaborate/students) to deliver the
course. On the day please click the link below to join the course room:
