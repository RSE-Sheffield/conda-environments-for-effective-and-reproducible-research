The lead instructor needs to schedule events on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) using the [RSE
Sheffield](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/rse-sheffield-29660305889) organisation. If you have not already been setup as
an administrator for this you should request to be included by another team member (see [RSES
Handbook](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/rses-handbook/blob/master/pages/eventbrite.Rmd) for further details).

**NB** - The easiest approach is to copy an existing event. From the page listing events select **Past** and click on
the three dots to the right of a past event and select `Copy Event`. Edit the title to remove `Copy of` and update the
dates and times.

## Details

A banner can be added to the event, some sample images are under the `resources/` directory of this repository, but if
you have copied a past event this will already be in place.

The following fields should be entered into each field on the **Details** page (they can be copy and pasted from a past event).

### Summary


> This is an introductory course, teaching the use of Conda Virtual Environments required to manage reproducible
> research.

### Description

> How can we effectively work together on the same code?
> This is an introductory course, teaching the use of Conda virtual environments for effective and reproducible research
> development lifecycle. These skills are essential for reproducible research.
> This event is for University of Sheffield researchers and research students only. Please register with a University of
> Sheffield email address to ensure your ticket request is accepted.
>
> **Prerequisite skills***: Some programming experience.
>
> ### Learning Objectives
> - Understand what Conda is and why it is useful for managing packages and environments in research workflows.
> - How to create, activate and delete Conda environments.
> - How to install and manage packages in Conda environments.
> - What Conda channels and packages are and how to use them.
> - How to use pip in Conda environments.
> - How to share your Conda environment.

> We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable
> better software and more open, reproducible research. However, free at point of use training is not free. The cost of
> a course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.
>
> If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking. Bookings can usually be
> cancelled using eventbrite.com or, failing that, by emailing rse@sheffield.ac.uk.
>
> Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and
> students, amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.
>
> Persistent failure to attend booked courses might result in you being excluded from future training opportunities.
>
> If we can do anything to make our courses more accessible for you to attend, please send suggestions to
> rse@sheffield.ac.uk; the Sheffield RSE Team are committed to making our training as accessible to a wide range of
> researchers as possible.
